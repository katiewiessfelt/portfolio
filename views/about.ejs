      <p>
        Hi, I'm Katie! I'm a software developer who loves problem-solving and creating clean, user-friendly websites and
        applications. I've worked with technologies like Python, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Docker, and I enjoy
        learning new tools and finding better ways to bring ideas to life online.
      </p>
      <p>Outside of coding, I'm usually hanging out with my husband and our two dogs or working on one of my many craft
        projects â€” crochet is my favorite. I love being creative, whether that's making something by hand or building a
        beautiful website that not only looks great but also fulfills a function people really need.
      </p>
